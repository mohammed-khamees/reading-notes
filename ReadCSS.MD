## CSS

CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its box and uses rules to indicate how the element should look Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.

Declarations are made up of two parts:

- the properties of the element that you want to change
- the values of those properties.

For example, the font-family
property sets the choice of font, and the value Arial
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.

We can change the color of the text for a specific element using color properties and there are many systems to change the color like RGB or hex or hsl all of them get you the same result of color but the value is different from one system to another and you can change the opacity of the color by adding the a value to each system as example rgba or hsla.
